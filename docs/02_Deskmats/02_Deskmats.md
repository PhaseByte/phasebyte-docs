## **Cleaning**

All our deskmats are hand and machine washable. We do recommended hand washing for keeping the lifespan of your deskmat as long as possible. 

### :material-hand-wash: Hand Washing

We have lots of videos on our TikTok watching our deskmats, but here are the instructions if you need them! 

1. In a bathtub or sink, wet the entire deskmat with luke warm water.
2. Using a mild detergent, pour the cleaning liquid on the deskmat. 
3. Depending on the level of the stains or spill, scrub lightly or with more force to remove any mess. Be careful not to go too intense on the printed stitched edges of the mat. You won't be able to remove the ink but you could cause preemptive fraying.
4. Rinse all the cleaning solution off of the deskmat. 
5. Print side down, place the deskmat in a towel and roll the deskmat with the towel. 
6. Let it dry for 24 hours.

2. Use a cold cycle with a mild detergent. 
3. Hang to dry.
