## Acoustics

### Lubing Stabilizers

You probably already know this one, but lubing your stabilizers dramatically improves the sound when pressing `Space`, `Shift`, `Enter`, and `Backspace`. You'll need a few extra tools and a little but of time but we highly recommend doing this to truly hear the tone of the PhaseOne. If you'd like to learn how, any YouTube tutorial should do! 

### Lubing Switches

Another one you probably already know, lubing your switches or making sure to purchase pre-lubed switches. You'll need a few extra tools like before and a lot more time but we highly recommend doing this or buying pre-lubed switches. If you'd like to learn how, any YouTube tutorial should do for the specific switches you are using! 

### Tape Mod

Some owners have used a thin tape to eliminate the high frequencies of certain switch and plate combinations. To do this, they apply tape on the across the entire back of the PCB (printed daughter board or electrical assembly).

## Aesthetics

### Foam Kit Modification

Some owners have cut away some of the supporting material between the function row (R1) and the number row (R2) to allow better pass through of the LEDs from the PCB (printed daughter board or electrical assembly), through to the LED bar.

## Quality of Life
