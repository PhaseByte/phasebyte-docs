# 4 // Improvements & Troubleshooting

## Known Issues

If you cannot find an issue you are having on this list, please let us know so we can make future PhaseOnes even better. And through software, maybe even the one you already have!

### Mechanical

 Issue      | Fix                          |

| Although very strong, the magnets cannot compress the case fully closed when using Poron gaskets on the top and bottom.| Currently, you can get the same type feel by using the Silicon gaskets on the top and the softer Poron gaskets on the bottom.|
| Some cables do not fit. Known cables that do not work: Apple USB-C to USB-C, Glorious Gaming Cable. | Try various USB-C cables or use a cable meant for mechanical keyboards from providers like Onyx Cables or Dispatch. We are currently working on a tech flex, affordable cable we can offer with the PhaseOne.|


### Electrical

 Issue      | Fix                          |
| :---------- | :----------------------------------- |
| The cable connecting the daughter board to the main board is twisted when installed correctly. | This does not affect performance, and the ribbon cable is designed to withstand folding and bending. However, we will make sure future iterations utilize a new daughter board with a corrected orientation header. |
| Green light when unplugging the USB-C cable from the PhaseOne. | We are still determining the cause of this bug, but it can be quickly fixed by using the LED controls to toggle the LED on/off. (`Fn + F1`) |
| The keyboard freezes or only works using bluetooth. | We have found that in most cases the cable connecting the daughter board is either improperly seated into the main board or has come loose. By opening the case and reseating the flat cable, the issue is resolved. |

### Wireless

 Issue      | Fix                          |
| :---------- | :----------------------------------- |
| Windows machines using the specific Intel AX200 Bluetooth Chip have intermittent connectivity issues like disconnecting. | Unfortunately, this issue cannot be fixed with the PhaseOne.  |
