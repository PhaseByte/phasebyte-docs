# 1 // Functionality

## Overview

The PhaseOne uses the latest and in our opinion, greatest, open-source firmware, [ZMK](https:www.zmk.dev). It supports Bluetooth and Wired keyboard operation and is built by a great community of contributors. Within a few months, ZMK will have a webpage to ZMK Studio to easily further customize your board without any coding ability. 

## Layout

The PhaseOne ships with configuration to support up to 5 Bluetooth connections and Wired performance with the following keymap:
