# 5 // Firmware

Here, you'll find any firmware updates! Of course, you can always customize your firmware using ZMK. However, from time to time we will release updates to make sure everyone is leveling up with us!

## 2024 - Sep
### ZMK Studio

In this update you'll find compatibility to remap your keys using ZMK's newest addition, ZMK Studio. It allows any PhaseOne (with the newest firmware) to update their layout using a web browser. 

To install a new update, first download the firmware file from our Google Drive link, here:

Once you have the file, follow these steps:

1. Remove your space bar from the PhaseOne. 
2. Underneath and through the plate, you'll find a little button on the PCB. This is the reset button. 
3. Plug in your PhaseOne to your computer using a USB-C cable. 
4. Press the reset button twice. You should see a folder pop up on your computer titled PhaseOne.
5. This is the boot loader where you can drag and drop firmware updates.
6. Drag the new firmware file into the PhaseOne folder. 
7. The keyboard should automatically close the folder and be ready for use!
